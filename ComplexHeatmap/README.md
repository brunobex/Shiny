## My first shiny app in shinyapps.io

This shiny app is used to show some function of ComplexHeatmap for heatmap

This app can be departed into two part:

1. Quickly visualize heatmap
2. Complexly visualize heatmap

The second part is used to apply multiple function in ComplexHeatmap to show a simple heatmap.

For example, the orientation of row/column name, the color of heatmap, the distance and algorithm for cluster and so on.

The url of shiny app: [ https://anlan.shinyapps.io/complexheatmap/]( https://anlan.shinyapps.io/complexheatmap/)

Your should first import .csv file, and this file should be normalized.

Then this app will show you a heatmap in "Quickly visualize heatmap" part.

You can also select some parameters to adjust heatmap in "Complexly visualize heatmap" part.

You can try to use the sample(cluster.csv) to run this shiny app.
